# Claude Pace Maker - Development Knowledge

## Related Codebase: Claude Usage Reporting

**IMPORTANT**: When the user says "claude usage" or "claude-usage", they mean the **claude-usage-reporting** codebase located at:
- `/home/jsbattig/Dev/claude-usage-reporting`

This is a separate tool that displays usage metrics in a monitor/dashboard format. It has a "Pacing Status" column where pace-maker integration features should be displayed.

- `pace-maker status` = CLI command from THIS repo (claude-pace-maker)
- `claude-usage` = Monitor tool from claude-usage-reporting repo

## Deployment After Code Changes

**CRITICAL**: After completing code changes to hook logic (`src/pacemaker/`), you MUST run the installer to deploy:

```bash
./install.sh
```

**Why:**
- Hooks are installed in `~/.claude/hooks/` (not the project directory)
- Code changes in `src/pacemaker/` won't take effect until hooks are reinstalled
- The installer copies updated Python modules, hook scripts, and prompt templates to the active location

**When to Deploy:**
- After any changes to `src/pacemaker/*.py` files
- After refactoring hook logic or intent validation
- After bug fixes in the pacing engine
- After modifying validation prompts in `src/pacemaker/prompts/`
- Before testing hook behavior changes

**Deployment Workflow:**
1. Make code changes in `src/pacemaker/`
2. Write/update tests (ensure >90% coverage)
3. If modifying intent validation logic: `pace-maker intent-validation off`
4. **Run `./install.sh` to deploy** ← CRITICAL STEP
5. If you disabled validation: `pace-maker intent-validation on`
6. Test the deployed hooks with manual verification

Without running the installer, your code changes remain undeployed and inactive.

## Intent Validation Development

**Bootstrapping Problem**: When modifying intent validation code while validation is enabled, you create a circular dependency where the validator blocks changes to itself.

**Solution**: Temporarily disable intent validation during development:

```bash
# Before modifying validation code
pace-maker intent-validation off

# Make your changes to:
# - src/pacemaker/intent_validator.py
# - src/pacemaker/prompts/pre_tool_use/*.md
# - src/pacemaker/hook.py (pre-tool validation logic)

# Deploy changes
./install.sh

# Re-enable validation
pace-maker intent-validation on

# Test that validation works correctly
```

This applies to:
- Intent validation Python code (`intent_validator.py`, `hook.py`)
- Validation prompt templates (`prompts/pre_tool_use/`)
- Clean code rules and core paths configuration
- Any code that affects the pre-tool validation hook
